Hello everyone,

Who am I? Someone in love with the world of data, with all its mysteries waiting to be solved.

Throughout the years, I have had the chance to get an intense hands on experience with data. I have utilized analytics tools such as Qlik products, Tableau, Power BI, Celonis; have fed them with various sources of data ranging from raw SAP tables to giant databases; have done ETL through Informatica, have prepared tabular models to run in SSAS; used cloud solutions both in GCP and AWS. I could read Python as if it was my mother tongue and writing SQL queries blindfolded is a piece of cake.

I am still looking forward to polish my skills I have acquired throughout this journey within the fields that I have not dived deep into yet.

And when it comes to the question why, the answer is an easy one: it's exciting to experience the unexperienced.
